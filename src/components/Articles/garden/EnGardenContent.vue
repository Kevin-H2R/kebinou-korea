      <p class="article__p"><vocab-word v-bind="vocab.today"/> I bring you with me in a <b>mesmerizing</b> place.
        And I'n not even exaggerating! The Morning Calm Garden is an arboretum located at a few dozen of kilometers of
        Seoul, in Í∞ÄÌèâ (Gapyeong). I went there by bus + train, 2H15mins travel from Hongdae,
        you also have the option to take the ITX (express train) which takes ~1h to go there, but you gotta book your ticket in advance.</p>

      <p>In short: 30000m¬≤ area, 5000 types of <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.plant"/>, 20 different sections,
        600000 visitors / year. Plenty to see !<br/>
        There's a different festival at each season so you can go there all year long. I went there in
        <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.winter"/>, on the night of the 31st of December and at this time was held the
        wonderful lights festival.<br/>
        Images are worth 1000 <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.word"/> as we say, so I let you with some pictures I took there.<br/>
        Funny thing is, it was -12¬∞C (felt as -15), so I had to delete 3/4 of the photos I took because I was
        shivering way too much  üòÖ.</p>
