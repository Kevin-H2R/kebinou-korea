      <p class="article__p">Hold up ! Stop drooling on your keyboard or on your mobile <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.phone" /> and read
        this article that Kebinou wrote for you on the legendary Nutella Ìò∏Îñ° (Hotteok).</p>
      <p class="article__p">First of all, what is a Ìò∏Îñ°? It's a desert, that we could compare to a pancake filled
        with a special mixture. You can find them everywhere in South Korea but especially when
        the temperature starts to fall. You can usually find them in street food stands.</p>

      <div class="text-center mb-16"><i class="text-caption">{{ $t('streetFoodCaption') }}</i></div>

      <p class="article__p">The origin of Ìò∏Îñ° seems to be coming from Chinese workers who arrived
        in South korea in 1927. They developed a lot of receipe for very cheap dishes in order for
        poor people to afford it. One of those dishes was Ìò∏Îñ°.<br/><i>Here I am talking about the origin
          of the Ìò∏Îñ° we can find nowadays everywhere in South Korea. It seems that the real Ìò∏Îñ° was created
          way earlier, around the end of the 19th century.</i></p>
      <p class="article__p">Preparation is quite easy: Flour, milk, surgar, baking powder for the dough, which can then
        be filled with a mix of: brown sugar, honey, peanuts, cinnamon, sesame seeds.<br/>The whole
        thing is then fried</p>

      <div class="text-center mb-16"><i class="text-caption">{{ $t('hotteokCaption') }}</i></div>

      <p class="article__p">The first time I heard about Ìò∏Îñ°, I obviously wanted to rush into the first one I would
        encounter, being a <span class="font-weight-bold">huuuuuuge</span> fan of cr√™pes/pancakes.
        And it's by my meighboorhood of Hongdae that one night, I met the Holy Grail. And I've got to admit
        I was a bit disappointed:<br> Over cooked, not enough filling, closer to card box than to a desert.
        The <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.granny"/> owning the street food stand tender eyes could not comfort me of this little
        disappointment<br>
        Buuuuut, I did not give up, and the second one I tried was delicious and matched my expectetions.
        Price is usually 1000‚Ç© (~0.75‚Ç¨), but can vary and especially if you want to try another flavour
        than the original Ìò∏Îñ°, you might pay a little more.</p>
      <p class="article__p">Speaking of which (nice transition huh?), I heard about a legend, a myth, a rare Ìò∏Îñ° that would give
        you a ticket straight to cloud 9 in business class. I give you :
        <span class="font-weight-bold">the Nutella Ìò∏Îñ°.</span></p>
      <p class="article__p">Without waiting, I grab a Seoul city <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.bike"/>
        (first time I rode a bike in ~15 years)
        and I'm on for a 1h30 ride along side the <vocab-word v-bind="vocab.hanRiver"/> until this sanctuary of pleasure
        (I needed to use as much kcal as I could before meeting this wonderful Ìò∏Îñ°, with whom I decided
        to get married since then). And well, I was not disappointed at all, it was pure pleasure.
        Filled with just enough Nutella, cooked perfectly, I am in paradise.
        I don't want to spoil you too much so I'll stop my description right here but I am sure you guys can,
        imagine easily how incredible this is, so come try it fast!<br>
        <i>By the way, this one is not a street food stand as I mentionned earlier. It got so famous
          that it has its own little shop now.</i></p>
